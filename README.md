# Source-Code-Line-Counter
A program to count the number of lines of code in a software project.

Run this program to find out how many lines of code are in your project! Tell it which file extensions to look for, and it will count all the lines in all the files that match those extensions. Also returns the total number of files and directories that it came accross in its search.

### Building
Working on adding a build system. ANT, probably. Check back later.

### Referenced Libraries
This program makes use of the JDom XML library. You can check them out [here](http://jdom.org).

### License
I haven't chosen which license to use yet. Chances are it will be GPL, but don't hold your breath. Check back later for this also.
